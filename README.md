# Customer-Complaint-Database

5/5/2016

Background: My family owns a small restaurant on the busiest part of Canadian city Halifax. 
In many instances, a customer may have an in-store credit they would like to apply to their order. 
In the off chance that they do, what we use to record said credits is a coiled notebook with written complaints throughout the pages; in which the customer must wait while one of our servers flips through the pages looking for the order. 

I decided to make this database to help out the family restaurant. It's very simple, using an SQLite database management system to record customer-complaint&credit data as a CSV text file, and organizes the data with the SQLite management queries. 
The client side and user interface is a window written on a JAVA engine. Again, very simple stuff. 

The project isn't very large to scale. I've decided to try this out as a side project as I find creditting our restaurants' customer complaints to be tedious, and quite some work. I aim to place a few hours a week on development of the project and should have it released by the beginning of July.
